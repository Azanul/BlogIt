    on:
      schedule: # Run workflow automatically
        - cron: '0 * * * *' # Runs every hour, on the hour
      workflow_dispatch: # Run workflow manually (without waiting for the cron to be called), through the GitHub Actions Workflow page directly
    permissions:
      contents: write # To write the generated contents to the readme
    
    jobs:
      update-readme-with-blog:
